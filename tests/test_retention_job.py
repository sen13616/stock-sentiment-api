"""tests/test_retention_job.py — Unit tests for the data retention job.

Verifies:
  - retention_job calls the three purge queries with the correct cutoff dates
    and signal-type filters.
  - The OHLCV constant covers every yf_*/ohlcv_* signal type used by the
    market layer.
  - The retention job is registered with the scheduler on a daily cron.
