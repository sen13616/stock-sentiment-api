"""
pipeline/confidence/staleness.py

Checks whether each data source's most-recent timestamp is within the
spec-defined freshness threshold.

Thresholds (spec §Layer 09)
----------------------------
    market   : 90 minutes during market hours; market-hours-aware outside
    news     : 6 hours  (lower bound of the 6–12 hour range)
    analyst  : 3 days   (lower bound of the 3–5 day range)
    insider  : 30 days  (lower bound of the 30–45 day range)
    macro    : 24 hours

A source is stale if:
  - its as_of timestamp is None (no data received), OR
  - (now − as_of) > threshold

Market staleness is market-hours-aware.  A score produced at Friday
21:15 UTC (end-of-day run) remains fresh all weekend and is not penalised
simply because markets are closed.  The 90-minute threshold only applies
while markets are actually open.
