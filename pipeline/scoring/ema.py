pipeline/scoring/ema.py

Exponential Moving Average (EMA) smoothing for the composite sentiment index.

Paper specification (Execution Architecture § Data Collection and Computation Layer):

    S_t^smoothed = α * raw_t + (1 - α) * smoothed_{t-1}

    α = 1 - 0.5^(dt / T½)

where T½ = 4 hours (default half-life).

Cold-start: when prev_smoothed is None (first-ever score for a ticker),
smoothed_t = raw_t.  This seeds the EMA with the first raw composite.

Gap behavior: large dt values are handled naturally by the α formula.
As dt → ∞, α → 1, so smoothed → raw.  After a 24-hour gap, α ≈ 0.984,
effectively resetting the EMA.  No threshold-based reset logic is used.

ema_obs_count: a monotonically increasing counter that tracks how many
EMA updates a ticker has received.  It starts at 1 on cold-start and
increments by 1 on every subsequent scoring tick.  It NEVER resets,
regardless of gap length or any other condition.
