"""
pipeline/explanation/templates.py

Rule-based explanation generator (Phase 1 / free tier).

Contract
--------
- Input  : ranked list[DriverRecord] from pipeline.scoring.drivers.extract_drivers()
- Output : plain-English explanation string (1–3 sentences)
- Constraint : only references signals present in the driver list.
               Never invents reasons not backed by data.

Template map
------------
Keyed on DriverRecord.signal (human-readable label produced by drivers._label()).
Each entry has three variants: "bullish", "bearish", "neutral".

Assembly strategy
-----------------
1. Take the top-ranked drivers (up to 3).
2. Split into primary-direction drivers and counter-direction drivers.
3. Build a lead sentence from the top 1–2 same-direction drivers.
4. If a notable counter signal exists (magnitude ≥ 0.3), append a second sentence.
